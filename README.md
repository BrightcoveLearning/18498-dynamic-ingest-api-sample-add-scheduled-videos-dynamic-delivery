# 18498-dynamic-ingest-api-sample-add-scheduled-videos-dynamic-delivery
In this sample, you will learn how to schedule videos to become available at some future time, so that they aren't accidentally played before they should be.  Note that this sample is for accounts using the Dynamic Delivery system. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see this version instead.
